# Nostromo

> Hudson: 8 meters. 7, 6...  
Ripley: They can't be. That's inside _the room_.  
Hudson: It's reading right, man! Look!  
Hicks: Well then you're not reading **it** right!  

_**NOTE:** There won't be anything here until FXMaps has enough to run with..._  


#### _Nostromo_ -  makes it easy and fun to track spatial anomalies in routes recorded from your phone.

Nostromo is...

* A Geospatial Route Tracking Anomaly Detector (and Route Predictor?)

* An all-in-one standalone tracking and mapping application created for the **[Numenta HTM Challenge](http://numenta.org/blog/2015/09/18/introducing-the-htm-challenge.html)**

***

**Nostromo** is powered by [FXMaps](https://github.com/cogmission/FXMaps) - A new JavaFX Mapping API which allows you to embed Google Maps in your JavaFX application and combines two API's (GMapsFX and google-maps-services-java) to allow one to easily use functionality missing in both, such as:
* Draw and plot routes and objects on your google map using JavaFx
* Use Google APIs such as Directions API and GeoCoding API - which the GMapsFX API doesn't offer!
* The above allows you to add routes to a map either by hand or by file, and automatically _**SNAP**_ routes to the nearest road or highway - when desired.
